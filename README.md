# Time-series GANs
Specialization project about time-series GANs as a part of my masters degree in Electronics Systems Design and Innovation at NTNU.

First focus of this project has been accessing and exploring the Cognite Open Industrial Data (OID). The purpose of the different files in this project is:
* [data_exploration.ipynb](data_exploration.ipynb): A lot of different data characteristics are explored, like sampling frequencies, histpgrams, missing values, stationarity of the signals and more.
* [intrasensor_divergence.ipynb](intrasensor_divergence.ipynb): Calculating the intrasensor KL divergence for a single sensor and all nine sensors as a system.
* [functions.py](functions.py): A lot of different punctions for plotting and calculating different things.
* [publicdata.py](publicdata.py): File for importing the data from the online Cognite OID platform.
